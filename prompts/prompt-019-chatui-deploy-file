The GenAI deployment is handled by a switch on the main infrastructure deployment script, not a separate file.

Do NOT create separate .sh or bash scripts. Use the existing PowerShell deployment script with the -DeployGenAI switch:

    .\deploy-infra\deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroup "rg-yourapp-YYYYMMDD" -Location "uksouth" -DeployGenAI

This single script handles everything:

1. Deploys all base infrastructure (App Service, SQL, Managed Identity, Monitoring)
2. When -DeployGenAI is specified, also deploys Azure OpenAI and AI Search
3. Retrieves the GenAI endpoints from deployment outputs
4. Configures the App Service with OpenAI and Search endpoint settings
5. Saves all configuration to the deployment context file

The chat UI is always deployed as part of the application. When GenAI resources exist, it connects to them. When they don't exist, it shows a friendly message explaining how to deploy with the -DeployGenAI switch.

This approach means:

- One deployment script, not multiple
- PowerShell only, no bash/shell scripts
- Consistent deployment experience
- Easy to add or skip GenAI resources
