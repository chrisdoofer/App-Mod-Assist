[NOT USED - This functionality is now handled by the -DeployGenAI switch in deploy-infra/deploy.ps1]

The infrastructure deployment script supports an optional -DeployGenAI switch that deploys Azure OpenAI and AI Search resources.

To deploy WITHOUT GenAI (basic app only):

    .\deploy-infra\deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroup "rg-yourapp-YYYYMMDD" -Location "uksouth"

To deploy WITH GenAI (full chat experience):

    .\deploy-infra\deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroup "rg-yourapp-YYYYMMDD" -Location "uksouth" -DeployGenAI

The chat UI will still be visible in both cases, but without GenAI resources it will show a message explaining that GenAI services weren't deployed.
